### Requirements

In order to properly [update Kali Linux](/docs/general-use/updating-kali/) on a USB, [persistence](/docs/usb/usb-persistence/) must be setup. If persistence is not setup, re-imaging the USB with an ISO from the [weekly](https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly/) build will be a suitable update.

### Process

The best way to update Kali on a USB is to follow the same way you would on a full install.

First ensure that `etc/apt/sources.list` is properly populated:

```console
kali@kali:~$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
kali@kali:~$
```

After that we can run the following commands which will upgrade us to the [latest Kali version](/docs/general-use/updating-kali/):

```console
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt update
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt full-upgrade -y
kali@kali:~$
```

Using this, the kernel will not be updated however. If the kernel is needed to be upgraded, perhaps there is a security vulnerability patched, a re-write would be needed with the latest ISO. If there is data that is needed to be saved, an rsync to a separate storage device would be a good way to backup that data.
