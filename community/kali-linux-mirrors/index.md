## Using Official Repositories

The Kali Linux distribution has two [repositories](/docs/general-use/kali-linux-sources-list-repositories/), which are mirrored world-wide:

- [http.kali.org](http://http.kali.org/) ([mirrorlist](http://http.kali.org/README?mirrorlist)): the main package repository;
- [cdimage.kali.org](http://cdimage.kali.org/) ([mirrorlist](http://cdimage.kali.org/README?mirrorlist)): the repository of pre-built Kali ISO images.

When using the default hosts listed above, you'll automatically be redirected to a mirror site which is geographically close to you, and which is guaranteed to be up-to-date. If you prefer to manually select a mirror, click on the **mirrorlist** link near each hostname above and select a mirror that suits you. You will then need to edit your `/etc/apt/sources.list` file accordingly with the chosen values.

IMPORTANT! Do not add additional repositories to your <a href="/docs/general-use/kali-linux-sources-list-repositories/"/>/etc/apt/sources.list</a> file.<br />
<br />
Doing so will most likely break your Kali installation.
