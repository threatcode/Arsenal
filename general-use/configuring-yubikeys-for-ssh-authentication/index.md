This document explains how to configure a Yubikey for SSH authentication

#### Prerequisites

Install Yubikey Personalization Tool and Smart Card Daemon

```console
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt install -y yubikey-personalization scdaemon
```

#### Detect Yubikey

First, you'll need to ensure that your system is [fully up-to-date](/docs/general-use/updating-kali/):

```console
kali@kali:~$ pcsc_scan
Scanning present readers...
Reader 0: Yubico Yubikey 4 OTP+U2F+CCID 00 00
  Card state: Card inserted,
Possibly identified card (using /usr/share/pcsc/smartcard_list.txt):
    Yubico Yubikey 4 OTP+CCID
```

#### Configuration<

In order for our Yubikey to be detected as a smart card, we'll need to set our Yubikey to CCID mode:

```console
kali@kali:~$ sudo ykpersonalize -m 86
The USB mode will be set to: 0x86

Commit? (y/n) [n]: y
```

After this modification, GPG should now be able to recognize our Yubikey as a smart card:

```console
kali@kali:~$ gpg --card-status
Reader ...........: Yubico Yubikey 4 OTP U2F CCID 00 00
Version ..........: 2.1
Manufacturer .....: Yubico
Key attributes ...: rsa2048 rsa2048 rsa2048
Max. PIN lengths .: 127 127 127
PIN retry counter : 3 0 3
```

Now we will need to change the default PIN that is configured.

{{% notice info %}}
The default PIN is 123456 and default admin PIN is 12345678.
{{% /notice %}}

```console
kali@kali:~$ gpg --change-pin
gpg: OpenPGP card no. F8482212202010006041587850000 detected
