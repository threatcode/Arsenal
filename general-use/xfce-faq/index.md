#### Switch Desktop Environments

**Q:** I absolutely love the new theme and I desperately want it, but without having to re-install my system. How can I migrate my existing Kali Linux installation?

**A:** Run `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y kali-desktop-xfce` in a terminal session to install the new Kali Linux Xfce environment. When asked to select the "*Default display manager*", choose `lightdm`.

Next, run `update-alternatives --config x-session-manager` and select Xfce's option. If you would also like to remove the Gnome window manager, which we do not recommend until you are sure you are ready to, run `apt purge --autoremove kali-desktop-gnome`. Be sure to run this *after* setting up Xfce.

Next time you login after a reboot you will have the Xfce theme, if you did not run the `update-alternatives` command you can choose "Xfce" in the session selector in the top right hand corner of the login screen.

**Q:** I installed Xfce, but it doesn't look like the preview. How can I get it to look the same?

**A:** If you are having issues, it may be that a config file is not set properly. First, backup .cache, .config, and .local. Next, running `rm -r .cache .config .local` and then rebooting will likely fix those issues.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Q:** How can I get a Kali Linux image with GNOME instead of Xfce?

**A:**  Just download the Kali GNOME image from [kali.org/downloads/](/get-kali/)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Q:** I tried Xfce and I really like it but I still would like to switch back to GNOME. How can I do that?

**A:** You can run `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y kali-desktop-gnome` in a terminal session.
Next time you login you can choose "GNOME" in the session selector in the top right hand corner of the login screen.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### HiDPI

**Q:** I have a HiDPI screen and everything looks tiny. Is there a way to improve that?

**A:** Please see our [HiDPI page](/docs/general-use/hidpi/)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### Screen Captures

**Q:** How can I take screenshots?

**A:** Press the `Print Screen` key on your keyboard will launch screenshooter. Pressing enter will take the screenshot. Alternatively you can click on the "*Screen-Recorder*" icon in the quick-launch panel (the far right icon in the panel next to the application menu) and choose "Screenshot".

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Q:** How can I record videos of my screen activity?

**A:** Pressing `Ctrl` & `Print Screen` on your keyboard will launch the screen recorder. Pressing `Enter` will start recording. Alternatively you can click on the "*Screen-Recorder*" icon in the quick-launch panel (the far right icon in the panel next to the application menu).

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### Theme

**Q:** How can I switch to a lighter, brighter theme?

**A:** Kali Linux provides two default themes: dark and light.
To switch to the light theme,
go to "*Settings -> Appearance*" and:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\- In the "*Style*" tab, select "*Kali-Light*"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\- In the "Icons" tab, select "Flat-Remix-Blue-Light"

go to "*Settings -> Window Manager*" and:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\- In the "*Style*" tab, select "*Kali-Light*"

To switch from "*Light*" to "*Dark*", just select the Dark themes in these settings.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Q:** I love the buttons on the right hand side, but I'd love them even more on the the left. How can I switch?

**A:** You can move the buttons from one side to the other in "*Settings -> Window Manager-> Style -> Button Layout*". Just drag and drop them to the other side of the word "Title".

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### No Terminal Showing Up

**Q:** When I try to launch the terminal, the window shows up, but the contents are empty, what gives?

**A:** There may be an issue with your graphics and the xfwm4 compositor in use.
To disable the compositor,
go to "*Settings -> Window Manager Tweaks*" from the main menu on the desktop and:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\- In the "*Compositor*" tab, uncheck Enable display compositing

If you want a compositor still, and the xfwm4 compositor isn't working for you, you can use an alternative like "*compton*".

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\- `sudo apt install -y compton`

Then to have it auto run at login,
go to "*Settings -> Session and Startup*" and:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\- In the "*Application Autostart*" tab, click "*Add*" and enter "*Compton*" for the name, and "*compton*" for the Command, then click "*OK*", log out, and back in.

Alternatively, if this issue is occurring in a VM disable 3D acceleration in the VM settings.

&nbsp;

#### Language Settings

**Q:** How can I change the GUI language?

**A:** In the LightDM login screen, select the desired language using the language selector on the right hand side of the top panel.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Q:** How can I change my keyboard layout?

**A:** The keyboard layout can be changed in "*Settings -> Keyboard -> Layout*"

&nbsp;

**Q:** How can I setup a different input method not available through "*Settings -> Keyboard -> Layout*", e.g. Japanese (Anthy)?

**A:**  You can install ibus to configure different input methods, for Anthy you also have to install ibus-anthy, i.e. via

`sudo apt install -y ibus ibus-anthy`

You can now add and configure various input methods through "*Settings -> iBus Preferences*".
Once configured, you can use the newly added "iBus" icon on the right hand side of the panel to select the preferred input method.
For a list of available input method engines, refer to:
