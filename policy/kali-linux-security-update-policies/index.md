The majority of the packages comprising the Kali Linux distribution are drawn directly from the Debian repositories. For those packages which have been incorporated into Kali Linux "as-is" - i.e. the vast majority - security updates arrive at essentially the same time for Kali Linux as for the main Debian distribution.

Other packages are supported on a best-effort basis by the Kali Linux development team.
