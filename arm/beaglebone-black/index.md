The [BeagleBone Black](http://beagleboard.org/BLACK) is a low-cost, community-supported ARM-based development platform aimed at developers and hobbyists. The BeagleBone Black runs a 1GHz Cortex-A8 CPU and includes hardware-based floating point and 3D acceleration; while much lower-powered than a desktop or laptop system, its affordability makes it an excellent option for a tiny Linux system.

The BeagleBone Black provides a microSD card slot for mass storage and if that device is bootable, will use it in preference to the board's "burned-in" Angstrom or Debian operating system.

By default, the Kali Linux BeagleBone Black image contains the [**kali-linux-default** metapackage](/docs/general-use/metapackages/) similar to most other platforms. If you wish to install extra tools please refer to our [metapackages page](/docs/general-use/metapackages/).

## Kali on BeagleBone Black - User Instructions

If you're unfamiliar with the details of [downloading and validating a Kali Linux image](/docs/introduction/download-official-kali-linux-images/), or for [using that image to create a bootable device](/docs/usb/live-usb-install-with-windows/), it's strongly recommended that you refer to the more detailed procedures described in the specific articles on those subjects.

To install a pre-built image of the standard build of Kali Linux on your BeagleBone Black, follow these instructions:

1. Get a fast microSD card with at least 16GB capacity. Class 10 cards are highly recommended.
2. Download _and validate_ the `Kali BeagleBone Black` image from the [downloads](/get-kali/) area. The process for validating an image is described in more detail on [Downloading Kali Linux](/docs/introduction/download-official-kali-linux-images/).
3. Use the **[dd](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/coreutils/dd.1.en.html)** utility to image this file to your microSD card (same process as [making a Kali USB](/docs/usb/live-usb-install-with-windows/).

In our example, we assume the storage device is located at `/dev/sdX`. Do _not_ simply copy these value, **change this to the correct drive path**.

This process will wipe out your microSD card. If you choose the wrong storage device, you may wipe out your computers hard disk.
{{% /notice %}}

```console
$ xzcat kali-linux-2024.1-beaglebone-black-armhf.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
```

This process can take a while, depending on your PC, your microSD card's speed, and the size of the Kali Linux image.

Once the _dd_ operation is complete, insert the microSD card into the BeagleBone Black and power it on.

You should be able to [log in to Kali](/docs/introduction/default-credentials/).

## Kali on BeagleBone Black - Image Customization

If you want to customize the Kali BeagleBone Black image, including changes to the [packages](/docs/general-use/metapackages/) being installed, changing the [desktop environment](/docs/general-use/switching-desktop-environments/), increasing or decreasing the image file size or generally being adventurous, check out the [Kali-ARM Build-Scripts](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm) repository on GitLab, and follow the _README.md_ file's instructions. The script to use is `beaglebone-black.sh`.

## Kali on Beaglebone Black - Build-Script Instructions

Kali does not provide pre-built images for download, but you can still generate one by cloning the [Kali-ARM Build-Scripts](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm) repository on GitLab, and follow the _README.md_ file's instructions. The script to use is `beaglebone-black.sh`.

Once the build script finishes running, you will have an "img.xz" file in the `images` directory where you ran the script from. At that point, the instructions are the same as if you had downloaded a pre-built image.

The easiest way to generate these images is **from within a pre-existing Kali Linux environment**.

To install Kali on your Beaglebone Black, follow these instructions:

1. Get a fast microSD card with at least 16GB capacity. Class 10 cards are highly recommended.
2. Use the **[dd](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/coreutils/dd.1.en.html)** utility to image this file to your microSD card (same process as [making a Kali USB](/docs/usb/live-usb-install-with-windows/).

```console
$ xzcat images/kali-linux-2024.1-beaglebone-black-armhf.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progres
```

This process can take a while, depending on your PC, your microSD card speed, and the size of the Kali Linux image.

Once the _dd_ operation is complete, boot up the Beaglebone with the microSD card plugged in.
