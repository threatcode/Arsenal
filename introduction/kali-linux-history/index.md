Kali Linux is based on years of knowledge and experience of building a pentestion testing Operating Systems, which has spanned over multiple previous projects. During all these project's life-time, there has been only a few different developers, as [the team](/about-us/) has always been small. As a result, Kali has been years in the making and has come a long way.

The first project was called **Whoppix**, which stood for **WhiteHat Knoppix**. As can be inferred from the name, it was based on Knoppix for the underlining OS. Whoppix had releases ranging from v2.0 to v2.7.

This made way for the next project, **WHAX** _(or the long hand, **WhiteHat Slax**)._ The name change was because the base OS changed from Knoppix to Slax. WHAX started at v3, as a nod towards it carrying on from Whoppix.

There was a similar OS being produced at the same time, **Auditor Security Collection** _(often getting shorted to just **Auditor**)_, once again using Knoppix, and efforts were combined (with WHAX) to produce **[BackTrack](https://www.backtrack-linux.org/)**. BackTrack was based on Slackware from v1 to v3, but switched to Ubuntu later on with v4 to v5.

Using the experience gained from all of this, **Kali Linux** came after BackTrack in [2013](/docs/introduction/press-release/). Kali started off using Debian stable as the engine under the hood before moving to [Debian](/docs/policy/kali-linux-relationship-with-debian/) testing when Kali became a rolling OS.
