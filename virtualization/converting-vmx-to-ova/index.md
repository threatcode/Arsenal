VMware has **VMX format** which works for VMware products. The other commonly found format which is **OVF**, as this is a open standard (**OVA** is OVF but compressed into a single file). There are times where converting between the two formats is required.

In order to convert from VMware's VMX to a OVA file, we will use [ovftool](https://code.vmware.com/web/tool/4.4.0/ovf). If you already have either [VMware workstation](/docs/virtualization/install-vmware-host/) or VMware fusion pre-installed, you may already have it (else it can be downloaded as a standalone program for free). Its default locations are:

- Linux: `/usr/bin/ovftool`
- OS X/macOS: `/Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Library/VMware OVF Tool/ovftool`
- Windows: `C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Workstation\OVFTool\ovftool.exe`

We will be using the [official Kali Linux VMware image](/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines) to convert. To start with unzip it to get access to the vmx within:

```console
kali@kali:~$ 7z x kali-linux-2024.1-vmware-amd64.7z
[...]
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ ls kali-linux-*-vmware-amd64.vmwarevm/*vmx
kali-linux-2024.1-vmware-amd64.vmwarevm/kali-linux-2024.1-vmware-amd64.vmx
kali@kali:~$
```

- - -

We can now start to convert by doing the following:

```console
kali@kali:~$ ovftool kali-linux-*-vmware-amd64.vmwarevm/*vmx kali-linux-rolling-amd64.ova
Opening VMX source: kali-linux-2024.1-vmware-amd64.vmwarevm/kali-linux-2024.1-vmware-amd64.vmx
Opening OVA target: kali-linux-rolling-amd64.ova
Writing OVA package: kali-linux-rolling-amd64.ova
[...]

kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ file kali-linux-rolloing.ova
kali-linux-rolloing.ova: POSIX tar archive
kali@kali:~$ ls -lah kali-linux-rolloing.ova
-rw-r--r-- 1 kali kali 3.4G Nov 10 23:18 kali-linux-rolloing.ova
kali@kali:~$
```

That's it!

The OVA file can be now move and used where needed such as to ESXi _(if the in-built upload feature is not working)_ or migrate to VirtualBox _(You may need to install [Guest Addition](/docs/virtualization/install-virtualbox-guest-additions/) if so)_.
