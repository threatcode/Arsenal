3. Resize system partition in TWRP
4. Flash and launch Magisk app to finish the rooting process
5. Flash NetHunter
6. Set NetHunter watch face 

## 1. Unlock the bootloader

- Connect your watch to your PC with it's USB cable, and fire up a terminal. 
- If you have set up your watch on the phone you can access settings, otherwise hold both buttons for a few seconds on the welcome screen.
- Enable developer settings by going to System -> About -> tap Build number 10 times
- Enable ADB, re-plug USB and accept debug from PC
- Reboot into bootloader with `adb reboot bootloader` from the terminal 
- Unlock bootloader with `fastboot flashing unlock`

## 2. Flash vendor image, TWRP, and optimized WearOS

Download and extract the installation files into a folder.
Please note Magisk 21.0 is recommended, included in the following link.

- Again enable ADB, and reboot to bootloader with `adb reboot bootloader`
- `fastboot flash vendor vendor.img`
- `fastboot flash recovery twrp-3.4.0-0-catfish.img`
- Boot into recovery by selecting it with the side buttons (switch with bottom one, select with upper button)

## 3. Resize system partition in TWRP

- Again enable ADB
- `adb reboot recovery`
